- 👋 Hi, I’m @aoyafunke1
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in I.T and meeting others like me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development using an online course and I've recently started back-end although I'm struggling quite a bit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all types of web development so I can build experience, and learn more about what is possible in webdev.
- 📫 How to reach me - send me a message - that IS a thing, right?
